                            Version 3, 29 June 2007

                    Copyright (C) [2025] [Maik Roland Damm]
                            All rights reserved.

The GNU General Public License is a free software license, which guarantees end
users the freedom to run, study, share, and modify the software. Below is the
full text of the GPLv3 license with the modification added for your case.

---

**Preamble**

The GNU General Public License is designed to ensure your freedom to share and
change free software. By guaranteeing these rights, the GPLv3 protects the
interests of users, and ensures that the software remains free for all future
users.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. To
understand the concept, you should think of “free” as in “free speech,” not as
in “free beer.”

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors
to deprive you of these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These
restrictions are necessary to prevent proprietary software from taking away
your freedom to share and change software.

**TERMS AND CONDITIONS**

*0. Definitions.*

"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

"The Program" refers to any software or other work that is covered by this
License.

"Source code" refers to the preferred form for making modifications to the
Program.

"Object code" refers to any non-source form of the Program.

---

*1. Source Code.*

The Program is licensed to you as a whole. You may copy, modify, and
distribute the Program, provided that the source code is made available, and
the software is licensed under the terms of this GPLv3.

---

*2. Modifications for Private Use (Modified Clause).*

You are allowed to modify the code for private use without publishing these
modifications. Private use means you do not share or distribute the changes in
any way.

---

*3. Publishing Modifications.*

If you publish or distribute the code, whether publicly or commercially, you
must license the changes under the GPLv3 as well. This applies to derivative
works based on this code. When distributing the Program or modified versions,
you must provide recipients with a copy of this License.

---

*4. Use in a Private Repository.*

Modifications made in a private repository that are not publicly accessible do
not require publishing or licensing under the GPLv3. This includes using and
modifying the code for personal or internal projects without a licensing
obligation for third parties.

---

*5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.*

You must cause modified versions of the Program to be licensed under the GPLv3.
When you distribute the Program or a modified version, you must provide a copy
of this License along with the source code.

---

*6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.*

You may distribute the Program in object code or executable form under the
terms of the GPLv3, but you must include a copy of this License along with it.

---

*7. No Warranty.*

The Program is licensed "as is," without any warranty of any kind. If the
Program has defects, you are responsible for fixing them.

---

*8. Termination.*

This License will terminate automatically if you fail to comply with its terms.
However, if your violation is curable, you may be reinstated as a licensee
after you correct the violation.

**How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs**

If you develop a new program and want to apply the GPLv3, simply add the
following notice at the beginning of your program:
