## What it is?

In the beginning **AngularTasks** was only a ***simple*** Todo for Tasks. With time many features like

 - Progressbar
 - Drag & Drop
 - DarkMode
 - Notifications
 - many more.

has been added to the Application and now, AngularTasks is a full personal tasks planing solution.

As now, all data is stored in the LocalStorage on your PC -> No Cloud option yet. You can run the Application as packed Electron Application for Linux, MacOs, Windows.

For special needs, AngularTasks also delivers a ready to run solution for docker, you just need to call the standard compose up comand.

ng build
```

To start a local development server, run:

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.
